# gltthule
Programs running on the gateway computer glt-thule.
These are mostly house-keeping type non-essential python scripts- perhaps
copies of the same scripts that are running on other computers. Re-visit
this to clean out the repository later, or add more files. The purpose
of the gateway computer is only to allow login to gltobscon for antenna
operation. But it is also often used by operators as a standalone computer
for their own work.
